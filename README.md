# Nutritest
This is an application to an CRUD API build in Express Js (Node Js) and data stored in PostgreSQL. The goal of this project is to build a web application to provide health professionals a tool to analyse nutrients intake. 

## How to install / run
Once you had fork the project you have to install the dependencies of the project with this command:

    npm run install

I highly recommend to check the .env.example file to configure the port of the server

With the dependencies installed you can now run the project. For this you can use:

    npm run start
   
This will initialize the server in localhost with the port specify in .env
Now you can make calls to the API with postman or another software of your choose.
